## GETTING STARTED

### Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Follow the instructions for your operating
system:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

###  Running Server

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
